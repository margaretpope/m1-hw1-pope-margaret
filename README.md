# My First Coding Assignment
![Lena](../lena.jpg)
## About Me
I live and work in my hometown, Birmingham, Alabama, where I live with my one-eyed cat, Lena. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. During the Covid lockdown, I took up needlepoint, and it has become my favorite hobby.
## Past Coding Experience
I have almost no coding experience. The most coding I have had to do is create line breaks and italicized titles in the back end of Wordpress for a couple of websites I have helped manage over the last few years. I look foward to continuing to learn.
## Career Goals
My goal is to move up the ranks at my current job to become the Director of Communications. Right now, about half of my job is in our communications department, and I want to be able to move into the department full time and leave the administrative assistant part of my job. I would also like to be able to freelance on the side.
